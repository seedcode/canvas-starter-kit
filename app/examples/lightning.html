<h2 class="sub-title">Canvas In Lightning</h2>
<p>Canvas apps as Visualforce page tabs work great in Lightning, and this kit has been set-up to look and work great in Lightning. Switch over to the Lightning experience (If you're not already there), and you'll see our resizing, navigation, queries and editing all work great. You'll find the kit in App Launcher/Other Items. Visualforce Tabs can be added to <a href="https://docs.releasenotes.salesforce.com/en-us/spring16/release-notes/rn_forcecom_general_lex_navigation_menus_create.htm" target="_blank">Navigation Menus</a>.</p>
